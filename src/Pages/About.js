I've been privileged to work across a wide range of industries, including printing, <br /> sports marketing, fashion, retail and many more. <br /> My design aesthetic? Clean. Tasteful. Powerful. In <br /> my work, I strive for creative that engages and <br /> connects with your target demographic. Creative <br /> that generates clicks, builds awareness, drives <br /> revenue. Oh, and I make sure it's on brand...and <br /> on budget. Every time. My passion for art and <br /> design is endless. I can sincerely say that I pour <br />my heart and soul into every project, making <br /> sure that my work meets – and exceeds – <br /> expectations. For me, collaboration is key. I <br /> believe that the best ideas come from working in <br /> tandem. Whether you're a neighborhood startup <br /> or a Fortune 500 company, I look forward to <br /> seeing what we can create together.</p>
